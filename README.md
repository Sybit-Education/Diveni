## Application Instructions and Requirements

### Technologies

Frontend communicates via REST and WebSockets with the backend.
The backend uses Spring boot and communicates with the mongoDb in a docker infrastructure.

- create empty file ``.env`` in directory ``backend`` first
- detailed documentation on the ``.env`` file can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/Sybit-Education/Diveni/blob/main/docs/guide/install.md)

#### Run with pre-built docker images using [docker-compose](https://github.com/Sybit-Education/Diveni/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
#### Run with self-build docker images using [docker-compose.dev](https://github.com/Sybit-Education/Diveni/blob/main/docker-compose.dev.yml)
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

### Run Diveni locally

#### Frontend
