# Setup

## JIRA Cloud

## JIRA Enterprise

For setting up the JIRA application, the steps described here should be sufficient: 
<https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/>

It doesn't matter what you enter in remaining fields (URL, name, type, and so on). 
This is because we only want to retrieve data from Jira, therefore we only need to set up a 
one-way (incoming) link from the client to Jira.

Afterwards, you will see the client secret and ID, which needs to be provided for Diveni on 
JIRA-Server.
