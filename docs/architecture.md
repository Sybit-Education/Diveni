1 Context diagram
----------------------

The diagram below is a context diagram. It serves to illustrate the system from a black box perspective. Furthermore, interfaces to other systems are also depicted here. 
A connection to a Jira instance is required.

2 Component diagram
--------------------------------------

Context delineation provided insight of the system from a black box perspective. In the building block view
the internal structure and the components to be developed are now considered.

3 API
-------------------

The current documentation for the REST API can be seen on https://pp.vnmz.de/api/swagger-ui.html.

This sequence diagram shows all Websocket commands and when they are used.

4 Testing
---------

Functionalities of the application must be tested sufficiently to ensure quality. 
Backend methods are tested by Java unit tests. The test coverage is at least 75%.
Front-end components are tested using smoke tests on a test server.
Github runners are also used to automatically trigger and verify the tests.
