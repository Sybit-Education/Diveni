      https://github.com/Sybit-Education/Diveni/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

2. Open 2 terminals in the projects root directory

3. Start backend
   a. Open the first terminal and enter these commands:
   b. cd /backend
   c. mvn spring-boot:run
   d. The backend should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:8081

## Connectors
### JIRA Connection
For setting up the JIRA application, follow step 1 of the here described steps:
<https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/>

It doesn't matter what you enter in remaining fields (URL, name, type, and so on).
This is because we only want to retrieve data from Jira, therefore we only need to set up a
one-way (incoming) link from the client to Jira.

Afterwards, you will see the client secret and ID, which needs to be provided for Diveni on
JIRA-Server.


# Remote Installation

## Setup (Gets improved)
1. In your local environment execute script in root/build-production.sh
2. Execute script root/docker-production.sh
3. Connect via ssh to your server and move file root/diveni.tar.gz onto it
4. Unzip content with tar –xf diveni.tar.gz
5. Execute script start_script.sh
