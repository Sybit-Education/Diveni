### Jira Cloud Connector

1. To set up Diveni to connect to JIRA Cloud instances, refer to this guide to generate an RSA public/private key pair:
   <https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication/#step-2--configure-the-client-application-as-an-oauth-consumer>

2. After that you need to define a `consumer key`. The `consumer key` can be anything as long as it matches the application link.
   The `private key` (generated in step 1) and the `consumer key` have to be entered as `JIRA_CLOUD_PRIVATEKEY` and `JIRA_CLOUD_CONSUMERKEY` in `backend/.env`

##  Create new Session with connection to Jira Cloud
To use JIRA Cloud with Diveni you can choose to either use our official server [Diveni.io](https://diveni.io) or use a self-hosted instance
of Diveni. Either way, the connection process is the same for both, but for your local instance you will need to provide different credentials.
::: info
You must be an administrator of your JIRA Cloud instance to create an application link for Diveni.
