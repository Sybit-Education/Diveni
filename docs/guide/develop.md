### Setup Project

1. Clone repository with Git from Github:
      git clone https://github.com/Sybit-Education/Diveni.git

      https://github.com/Sybit-Education/Diveni/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. Start backend
   a. Open  first terminal and enter these commands:
   b. cd /backend

## Connectors

### JIRA Connection


### JIRA Cloud

TODO

### JIRA Enterprise

For setting up the JIRA application, the steps described here should be sufficient: 
<https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/>

It doesn't matter what you enter in remaining fields (URL, name, type, and so on). 
This is because we only want to retrieve data from Jira, therefore we only need to set up a 
one-way (incoming) link from the client to Jira.

Afterwards, you will see the client secret and ID, which needs to be provided for Diveni on 
JIRA-Server.

## Troubleshooting

- When working with IntelliJ and starting Diveni's Backend with IntelliJs editor it may throw an
  exception when trying to connect with Jira.\
  This is because it can not find the desired .env file in your working directory (/backend).
  When this happens make sure to include ```/backend``` to your run working directory in the run
  configuration settings.
