# Software Architecture

## Layer Diagram

Context delineation provided insight of the system from a black box perspective. In the building block view
the internal structure and the components to be developed are now considered.

Diveni is separated in four Docker containers:

flowchart TD
  Browser(Browser)
  subgraph Reverse-Proxy-Container
    direction RL
      Reverse-Proxy
  end  
  subgraph Frontend-Container
    direction RL
      Frontend
  end
  subgraph Backend-Container
    direction RL
      Backend
  end
  subgraph Database-Container
    direction RL
      Database[(Database)]
  end  

  Browser  <-- https/wss --> Reverse-Proxy
  Reverse-Proxy <-- http/ws --> Frontend
  Reverse-Proxy <-- http --> Backend  
  Frontend <-- http/ws --> Backend
  Backend <--> Database
  
```

The main layers are:

* **Reverse Proxy:** nginx based reverse proxy passing requests to frontend and backend
* **Frontend:** vue.js based web frontend
* **Backend:** Java/Spring Boot based backend
* **Database:** MongoDB persistence

These layers are separated to different Docker containers for most flexibility and easy updates.
