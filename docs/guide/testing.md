# Testing

Functionalities of the application must be tested sufficiently to ensure quality.
Backend methods are tested by Java unit tests. The test coverage is at least 75%.

Front-end components are tested using manual smoke tests on a test server.

GitHub Runners are also used to automatically trigger and verify the tests.
