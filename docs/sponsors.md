### Department of Computer Science

With 30 professorships, the 
[department of Computer Science](https://www.htwg-konstanz.de/en/the-university/departments/computer-science/overview/) 
has a very broad profile and offers students a high degree of choice. The training takes place in groups of 25 to 45 
students. The groups are even smaller for the numerous exercises, case studies and project groups. In accordance with 
the character of a University of Applied Sciences, the teaching staff of the department of Computer Science is mainly
recruited from industry and accordingly has, in addition to an excellent scientific background, intensive practical 
experience.

The department of Computer Science is very active in research and has numerous contacts with industry and 
research institutes. This allows students to be actively involved in current topics in computer science, especially 
in projects and their final theses. Additionally, the university and department have long-lasting partnerships with 
foreign universities.
